        After finishing by BA in History and spending a year abroad living in Ireland completing a MA in Archaeology,
        I realized that academic fields do not offer much opportunity to enter the field, let alone opportunity for growth.
        Thus, I endeavored to teach, only to realize that I needed to be teaching adults or not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, I looked at my skills and passions and realized that the technology field would be a
        good fit for me. Plenty of opportunity to challenge myself, learn new things, and grow as an individual and eventual employee.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, at the recommendation of a friend, I turned my sights to the  Full-Stack Development Career Change Track at Centriq.
        The rest - as they say- is history.

        How my hobbies
        <strong>help me be a better developer</strong>
    </h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    <p>
        If someone told me, when I first started learning to code, that being able to read
        crochet and knitting patterns would help me read code, I would have thought they were crazy.
        However, the more I learn, the more I realize that just as I've come to know the intricacies
        of patterns - their distint abbreviations - what causes a repeat - what signals the end, that each coding language
        is much the same - just another set of directions that a computer(or I) follows. Mistakes
        in patterns leads to mistakes in a finished product! So do errors in code!
    </p>
    <p>So now when I get an error message, I think back to the troubleshooting method I've used for years:</p>
    <ol class="crochetcomp">
        <li>
            What type of error message it?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is it a spelling (syntax) error?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did the author put sc when they meant dc?</li>
                        <li>Did the developer forget to add the 'm' when assigning a value to a decimal?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is it a logic error?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did the author put the incorrect number of stitches as the condition for ending a repeat?</li>
                        <li>Did the developer use the wrong <> as the condition on their loop?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now that I've found the error, how do I fix it?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is it a simple error? A missing {}? A dropped stitch?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Great! Fix it!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is it a more complex error? The mistake doesn't jump right out a me?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break the problem into smaller pieces: Where does the problem start? end?</li>
                        <li>Make a plan to solve the problem</li>
                        <li>Get to work!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat as needed</li>
    </ol>

        <img style="width:30%" src="img/Captureknitting.PNG" />
    </center>
    <p>
        So it might be a stretch to say that becoming a better knitter makes be a better developer,
        but to be able to see similarities between them and draw on now instictual knowledge that I never could
        have imagined would be helpful in this field, is such an amazing experience!
